# Applit ðŸŒ¶

Web App Framework for building Stateful Apps with lit-html ðŸ”¥ View Layer

## Status

**Early alpha** This project is more of a tryout to see if it's possible to create something like 
[hyperapp](github.com/hyperapp/hyperapp) but make use of `lit-html` as view layer.

#### Roadmap and ideas
  
* lifecycle events (oncreate, ondestroy, etc)
* payload to call 'actions' with data
* async (for calls to api's)
* lazy components using [dynamic imports](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-dynamic-import)

## Example

Try an example [here codesandbox.io](https://codesandbox.io/s/xlr2pvmro4?module=%2Fsrc%2Findex.ts)

## Getting Started

This is a very minimal example to get you started. 
A simple counter, with `up` and `down` actions.

Install applit and parcel (to build and run the app).

```bash
npm init -y
npm install --save applit lit-html
npm install --save-dev parcel
```

Create an `src/index.js`

```javascript
import { html } from 'lit-html'
import { applit } from 'applit'

const up = () => state => ({ count: state.count + 1 })
const down = () => state => ({ count: state.count - 1 })

applit(
  () => ({ count: 0 }),
  (bind, state) => html`
    <h1>Counter</h1>
    <p>${state.count}</p>
    <button onclick=${bind(up, bind)}>Up</bind>
    <button onclick=${bind(down, bind)}>Down</bind>
  `,
  document.body
)

```

And use it in the `src/index.html`

```html
<html>
<body>
  <script src="./src/index.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

Now run Parcel and view it in your browser 
(`npx` is a tool to run `node_modules/.bin` executables from the project)

```bash
npx parcel ./src/index.html
```
